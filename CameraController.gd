# Handle the motion of both players' camera as well as communication with the
# SplitScreen shader to achieve the dynamic split screen effet
# 
# Cameras are place on the segment joining the two players, either in the middle 
# if players are close enough or at a fixed distance if they are not.
# In the first case, both cameras being at the same location, only the view of 
# the first one is used for the entire screen thus allowing the players to play 
# on a unsplit screen.
# In the second case, the screen is split in two with a line perpendicular to the
# segement joining the two players.
# 
# The points of customization are:
#   max_separation: the distance between players at which the view starts to split
#   split_line_thickness: the thickness of the split line in pixels
#   split_line_color: color of the split line
#   adaptive_split_line_thickness: if true, the split line thickness will vary 
#       depending on the distance between players. If false, the thickness will
#       be constant and equal to split_line_thickness
